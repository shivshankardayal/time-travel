    <d:title>Preface</d:title>
      <d:para>
        I am a very unhappy person and am tired of all the idiocy going on in
        this world. Since I cannot fix all this I am going to do this in my
        virtual world with my imaginary time machine. You are most welcome on
        this journey of time travel. Know this that no stone will be left
        unturned to make this jounrney pleasant, peaceful and enjoyable.
        After all I got to fix all the problems. Some of it will be fun and
        some of it will be pure nonsense. It is purely imaginary and none of it
        is true. So sit back, get your favorite cold drink and enjoy.

          I do not have much to write in preface as I have covered most of it in Chapter 1.
          Therefore, I will skip directly to acknowledgements section. First, I would like to thank my
          parents, wife and son for taking out their fair share of time and the support which they
          have extended to me during my bad times. After that I would like to pay my most sincere
          gratitude to my teachers particularly H. N. Singh, Yogendra Yadav, Satyanand Satyarthi,
          Kumar Shailesh and Prof. T. K. Basu. Now is the turn of people from software community. I
          must thank the entire free software community for all the resources they have developed to
          make computing better. However, few names I know and here they go. Richard Stallman is the
          first, Donald Knuth, Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, Bjarne Stroustrup after that. I possibly
          cannot write all the names because then possibly an entire chapter will be full of those
          names. :-) I am using Docbook to write this book therefore obviously Normal Walsh deserves
          praise for his work on it. Anyone who uses computers has got to be grateful to all the
          winderful programmers, engineers and scientists who have made life better.

          I am not a native English speaker and this book has just gone through one pair of eyes
          therefore chances are high that it will have lots of errors. Please feel free to drop me
          an email at <d:email>shivshankar.dayal@gmail.com</d:email>. I will try to fix all errors and
          incorporate your valuable suggestions.
